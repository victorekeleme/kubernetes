Persistent Volume Claim (Namespaced=true)
=========================================
Simply ->
-> It's a request for storage(volume).
-> with PVC we can request(Specify) how much storage we need and with what access mode

Pods that need access to persistent storage, obtain that access through the use of a Persistent Volume Claim.
A PVC, binds a persistent volume to a pod that requested it. 
When a pod wants access to a persistent disk, it will request access to the claim which will specify the size , access mode and/or storage classes that it will need from a Persistent Volume.
Indirectly the pods get access to the PV, but only through the use of a PVC.

Note->
-> Persistent volume(PV) needs to be available for Persistent Volume Claim(PVC)
-> Relationship btw PVC ===> PV is one to one relationship
-> if PVC has claimed a PV another PVC can't claim the PV


Persistent Volume (Namespace=False)
===================================
Persistent Volumes are simply a piece of storage in your cluster. Similar to how you have a disk resource in a server, a persistent volume provides storage resources for objects in the cluster.

Static Volumes
-> A static PV simply means the volumes provisioned by a k8s administrator manually in the cluster and itâ€™s ready to be consumed by other resources.

Dynamically Volumes
-> Provisioning (creating) volumes dynamically using StorageClass

StorageClass (Namespace=false)
-> Provisions persistent volumes (PV) dynamically for a specified persistent volume claim (PVC) in the cluster.

Note->
PVC and PV get associated by aaccessModes and storage capacity. meaning they must match for PVC to claim a PVC.


accessModes
==============
- ReadWriteOnce (RWO)-> (AWS EBS, Azure Disk, Azure File, NFS)
    -> The volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node.
    -> This access mode still can allow multiple pods to access the volume when the pods are running on the same node
- ReadWriteMany (RWX) -> (NFS, Azure File)
    -> The volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes
- ReadOnlyMany (ROX) -> (NFS, Azure File)
    -> The volume can be mounted as read-only by many nodes
- ReadWriteOncePod (RWOP) ->
    -> The volume can be mounted as read-write by many pods

ReclaimPocily (Manages what happens to data when PVC is deleted)
============== 
Retain -> If we delete PVC the associated PV stored will be retained.
Recycle -> If we delete PVC the associated PV also gets recycled (deletes the data and makes itself available for another PVC).
Delete -> If we delete PVC the associated PV also gets deleted.
